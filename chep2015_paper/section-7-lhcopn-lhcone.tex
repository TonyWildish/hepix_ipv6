\section{LHCONE/LHCOPN}
Based on the actions initiated at Grid Deployment Board in November and December 2014, to request tier-1s to join the HEPiX-IPv6 working group and to encourage sites moving their production endpoints to dual stack even if this requires concessions of the quotation of their site relatability and site availability. The proposal of the LHC experiment Atlas was to
	- request that all Tier-1s has to provide 
		? besides an IPv6 peering to LHCOPN,
		? a dual stack PerfSONAR machine by first of April 2015
	- request that Tier-2s provide 
		? Besides an IPv6 peering to their LHCONE connection,
		? a dual stack PerfSONAR machine by August 2015.
At the last LHC[OPN/ONE] meeting a proposal was stated that:
LHCOPN connecting Tier-1 sites to CERN gets ipv6 ready by 1. April 2015 and
LHCONE connecting Tier-[123] sites geting ipv6 ready in August 2015.
No objections to this proposal were presented. The url: http://maddash.aglt2.org/maddash-webui/index.cgi?dashboard=Dual-Stack%20Mesh%20Config shows the status of the tier-[12] sites connecting a dual stack perfsonar and implies that there are still some LHC tier-1 sites more than two month after the agreed deadline not offering ipv6 cidr via their LHCONE peering.
