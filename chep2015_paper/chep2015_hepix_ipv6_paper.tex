\begin{abstract}
The world is rapidly running out of IPv4 addresses; the number of IPv6 end systems connected
to the internet is increasing; WLCG and the LHC experiments may soon have access to worker
nodes and/or virtual machines (VMs) possessing only an IPv6 routable address. The HEPiX
IPv6 Working Group ({\tt http://hepix-ipv6.web.cern.ch/}) has been investigating, testing and
planning for dual-stack services on WLCG for several years. Following feedback from our
working group, many of the storage technologies in use on WLCG have recently been made
IPv6-capable. The worldwide HEP computing community now needs to deploy dual-stack
IPv6/IPv4 services on WLCG to allow such use of IPv6-only resources.
This paper will present the IPv6 requirements, tests and plans of each of the four LHC
experiments together with the tests performed both on the IPv6 test-bed and in targeted use
of WLCG production services. This is primarily aimed at IPv6-only worker nodes or VMs
accessing several different implementations of a global dual-stack federated storage service.
The changes required to the operational infrastructure, including monitoring and security, will
be addressed as will the implications for site management. The working group will present
its deployment plan for dual-stack storage services, together with other essential central and
monitoring services, to start during 2015.
